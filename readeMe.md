## My process

I started by looking at figma files and writing down the possible routes I can take in terms of setting up my files. I then strctured my HTML file, then i used the figma file to get the appropriate colors and sizing to set up my CSS file.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- The Color API

### What I learned

This project was a very cool to to as it was my first time getting data from an API and communicating with it. I all about parsing data, the then() method and the catch() method.

### Continued development

In the future, i would like to modify the design.
